#
# MACHINE REQUIREMENTS
#   These tests are set up for the Othermill but should work with most any machine
#   XY must have > 50mm clearance from zero in the positive direction
#   Z must have > 50mm clearance in the neqative direction from zero
#   Machine must have a contacting probe to be used in the Z axis
#
# MACHINE SETUP: Prior to running this file:
#   Verify a probe tool is inserted and a probe surface is present
#   Verify a probing input has been configured - typically Zmin (5)
#   Verify that input has been setup for probing INPUT_FUNCTION_PROBE
#
#   Home machine to (0,0,0) where Z zero is maximum positive
#   Position Z probe tip ~30mm above the probe contact surface (will become z=0)
#   Probes from the following positions should contact the probe surface:
#     (0,0,0)
#     (25,25,0)
#   On the Othermachine homing followed by g0 x50 y50 z-30 works well
